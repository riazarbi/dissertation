Here we argue for the adoption of measures to optimize key elements of the scientific process: methods, reporting and dissemination, reproducibility, evaluation and incentives. There is some evidence from both simulations and empirical studies supporting the likely effectiveness of these measures, but their broad adoption by researchers, institutions, funders and journals will require iterative evaluation and improvement. We discuss the goals of these measures, and how they can be implemented, in the hope that this will facilitate action toward improving the transparency, reproducibility and efficiency of scientific research.},

abstract = {Most firms and portfolio managers rely on backtests (or historical simulations of performance) to select investment strategies and allocate them capital. Standard statistical techniques designed to prevent regression over-fitting, such as hold-out, tend to be unreliable and inaccurate in the context of investment backtests. We propose a framework that estimates the probability of backtest over-fitting (PBO) specifically in the context of investment simulations, through a numerical method that we call combinatorially symmetric cross-validation (CSCV). We show that CSCV produces accurate estimates of the probability that a particular backtest is over-fit.},

We stress that this shouldn't be a question of dogma, but should be resolved empirically. There are situations where equilibrium models provide useful predictions and there are situations where they can never provide useful predictions. There are also many situations where the jury is still out, i.e., where so far they fail to provide a good description of the world, but where proper extensions might change this. Our goal is to convince the skeptics that equilibrium models can be useful, but also to make traditional economists more aware of the limitations of equilibrium models. We sketch some alternative approaches and discuss why they should play an important role in future research in economics.},

Noise causes markets to be somewhat inefficient, but often prevents us from taking advantage of ineffiencies. Noise in the form of uncertainty about future tases and technology by sector causes business cycles, and makes them highly resistant to improvement through government intervention. Noise in in the form of expectations that need not follow rational rules causes inflation to be what it is, at least in the absense of a gold standard or fixed exchange rates. Noise in the form of uncertainty about what relative prices would be with other exchange rates makes us think incorrectly that changes in exchange rates or inflation rates cause changes in trade or investment flows or economic activity.

First, I use twenty-five test portfolios constructed using a double-sort on betas and standard deviations of the residuals of the underlying securities (while still maintaining the same timing assumptions and method of Fama and MacBeth; 1973). I find that the coefficient on the average standard deviation of the residuals becomes significant in the cross-sectional regressions, even for the 1929-1968 time period. This goes against some of the results in Fama and MacBeth (1973) and hints that these results may not have been robust. In particular, I alternate between using an equal-weighted and value-weighted NYSE portfolio as proxy for the market portfolio. I also alternate the construction of the test portfolio estimates between equal-weighting and value-weighting of the underlying securities estimates. I find that the Fama-MacBeth (1973) results are unaffected by these variations if the test portfolios are constructed using a single sort on betas as done in Fama-MacBeth (1973). But with test portfolios built with a dual-sort much of the Fama-MacBeth (1973) results are undone. ¦ I am grateful to Aaron Foss for providing me with helpful comments, suggestions, and feedback.},

In this exploratory research paper, we start from this premise and posit that all existing index structures can be replaced with other types of models, including deep-learning models, which we term learned indexes. The key idea is that a model can learn the sort order or structure of lookup keys and use this signal to effectively predict the position or existence of records. We theoretically analyze under which conditions learned indexes outperform traditional index structures and describe the main challenges in designing learned index structures. Our initial results show, that by using neural nets we are able to outperform cache-optimized B-Trees by up to 70{\%} in speed while saving an order-of-magnitude in memory over several real-world data sets. More importantly though, we believe that the idea of replacing core components of a data management system through learned models has far reaching implications for future systems designs and that this work just provides a glimpse of what might be possible.},

The goal of this exercise is to create a set of portfolios that explain the cross-section of average returns. This result obtains if and only if the set of factor-portfolios span the mean-variance efficient portfolio. We argue that this is unlikely to be the case, as factor portfolios constructed in this way fail to incorporate information about the covariance structure of returns. By using a high statistical power methodology to forecast future covariances, we are able to construct a set of portfolios which capture the characteristic premia, but hedge out much of factor risk. We apply our methodology to the Fama and French (2015) five-factors, and construct a portfolio orthogonal to their factor with annualized Sharpe-ratio of 0.84.},

abstract = {This article develops and applies new measures of portfolio performance which use benchmarks based on the characteristics of stocks held by the portfolios that are evaluated. Specifically, the benchmarks are constructed from the returns of 125 passive portfolios that are matched with stocks held in the evaluated portfolio on the basis of the market capitalization, book-to-market, and prior-year return characteristics of those stocks. Based on these benchmarks, “Characteristic Timing” and “Characteristic Selectivity” measures are developed that detect, respectively, whether portfolio managers successfully time their portfolio weightings on these characteristics and whether managers can select stocks that outperform the average stock having the same characteristics. We apply these measures to a new database of mutual fund holdings covering over 2500 equity funds from 1975 to 1994. Our results show that mutual funds, particularly aggressive-growth funds, exhibit some selectivity ability, but that funds exhibit no characteristic timing ability.},

abstract = {We develop a simple stock selection model to explain why active equity managers tend to underperform a benchmark index. We motivate our model with the empirical observation that the best performing stocks in a broad market index often perform much better than the other stocks in the index. Randomly selecting a subset of securi-ties from the index may dramatically increase the chance of underperforming the index. The relative likelihood of underperformance by investors choosing active management likely is much more important than the loss to those same investors from the higher fees for active management relative to passive index investing. Thus, active management may be even more challenging than previously believed, and the stakes for finding the best active managers may be larger than previously assumed.},

@article{Fama2012,
abstract = {a b s t r a c t In the four regions (North America, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific) we examine, there are value premiums in average stock returns that, except for Japan, decrease with size. Except for Japan, there is return momentum everywhere, and spreads in average momentum returns also decrease from smaller to bigger stocks. We test whether empirical asset pricing models capture the value and momentum patterns in interna-tional average returns and whether asset pricing seems to be integrated across the four regions. Integrated pricing across regions does not get strong support in our tests. For three regions (North America, Europe, and Japan), local models that use local explanatory returns provide passable descriptions of local average returns for portfolios formed on size and value versus growth. Even local models are less successful in tests on portfolios formed on size and momentum.},
